        <p>I can't decide how to start this paragraph, I miss our adventurous walks in the woods, I miss our very cold swims, I miss our dinners with board games, I miss our drunk DnB nights, I miss you a lot.
            with that away I want to say again I am so glad we have met and become friends, you made me better person, even though i was not honest with you in some issues I had, you were always there for me
            I appreciate everything you did for me. you are the best and you deserve everything best in this world. Since I can't be there to give you anything in person, I am sending those gifts here hahah <em>&mdash;yellow blue bus</em>
